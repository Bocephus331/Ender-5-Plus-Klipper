# Ender-5-Plus-Klipper
Klipper firmware for Ender 5 plus running Ender Sprite Direct Drive Extruder and BTT SKR Mini E3. V2

I am uploading this if anyone runs a similar setup and needs the file. I have taken a file similar to my machine and changed the code to work with my setup. 

[include shell_command.cfg]
[include mainsail.cfg]
[include logger.cfg]
